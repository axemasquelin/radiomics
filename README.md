# Perinodular Parenchymal Features Improve Indeterminate Lung Nodule Classification
## Abstract
Purpose: To evaluate the consistency with which perinodular radiomic features extracted from low-dose computed tomography serve to distinguish benign from cancerous pulmonary nodules using a variety of machine learning approaches.

Materials and Methods: Using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), we selected for individuals with pulmonary nodules between 4mm to 20mm in diameter. Nodules were then segmented to generate four unique datasets; a tumor-specific dataset describing tumor-specific features, a 10mm Band dataset that contains features from the segmented nodule boundary to 10mm out from the boundary, a 15mm Band dataset, and a Lung-RADS diameter dataset containing the nodules maximum diameter. Models to predict malignancy were constructed using support-vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approaches. Five-fold cross validation with 10 repetitions per fold was used to evaluate the performance of each methodology and dataset.
